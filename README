JavaScriptLint.vim is a Vim plugin that allows the JavaScript Lint (jsl) 
program from http://www.javascriptlint.com to be tightly integrated with 
Vim.  

Once installed, the contents of a javascript file will be passed 
through the jsl program after the file's buffer is saved.  Any lint 
warnings will be placed in the quickfix error window, which provides
easy navigation to the source of the warning.

This can be disabled with "let jslint_onwrite=0" on your vimrc, and call
JavaScriptLint command instead.

JavaScript Lint must be properly installed on your system for this 
plugin to work.  This page should get you started:
